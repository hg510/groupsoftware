            <p>Being climate-friendly starts with a mindset and acts such as walking to your
              campus daily instead of taking a bus or using disposable utensils instead of plastic ones, as it affects
              air
              quality through industrialism.Â </p>

              the game and make it a daily ritual to complete the chores and play.</p>
